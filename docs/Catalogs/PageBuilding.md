# **Page Building**


{==

## **Sections / Headers**

==}

- Each section ***Header*** should be linked to first SKU in that section in order to auto-populate text


---


{==

## **Elements and Components**

==}

- ***Tabs*** and ***Footers*** are on the Page Element (Master Page)
- Everything else is tied to ***item*** on page

---

### **Copying Component Templates from other Projects**


---


{==

## **Images**

==}

1. Size image boxes FIRST
2. Select correct “Component”
3. Add PSD to box with Component selected so it gets assigned correctly

!!! note "Detail/Enlargement boxes are ~200% larger than regular image"
    If item image is 25% scale, Detail box would be scaled to 50%


---


{==

## **Colors**

==}

!!! note "Try to stick to 3-color values"
    - One of the CMYK values should equal 0
        - i.e. (#,#,0,#), (#,#,#,0), etc.
    - Not always possible, but it helps when printing


*Can we have Color Swatches labeled?*


---


{==

## **Tables**

==}

- Set Column Number: “Number of Columns” in top toolbar in InDesign
- Hard Return after each “block” of data
- Shift + Return on last row to remove “bottom bar”

- Use “Direct Table” to troubleshoot and see what’s missing/causing errors
- Try Creating Direct Table if table is not coming in but the data looks like it’s there!

- “Group Ordering” is only used in “Sort by” NOT as a “Criterion”
    - Double click group, Group Properties, can edit “Sorting”

!!! note
    There is no attribute for the merchants to use for us to be able to sort tables in the order they want using group ordering.
    They have to manually put them in order as part of the whiteboarding process.
